## Covid Prognosis System (CPS)

CPS or Covid Prognosis System project is a cloud based application to help the hospitals, manage their activites easily and to help them in detecting COVID-19 patients using chest X-ray and CT Scans.  


###  Few of the proposed features include:

  1. Detection and segmentation of infected areas inside the patient's lungs in chest CT scans using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
  1. A smart hospital management system dashboard, to manage patient's records, reports and track his/her progress.
  1. Generating full medical reports for any patient in a PDF, with just a click. 
  1. Directly add records for previous patients by uploading csv files.
  1. Keeping hospitals data in-sync with Health Ministry's Centralized Database.
  1. Give detailed analytics based on the collected data.
  1. An AI based image screening assesment for every patient.
  1. Sharing the progress reports with Patient's Family members directly through a mobile app.
  
More features could be added later on.

### Technologies we'll be using

  1. Tensorflow for Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
  1. OpenCV.
  1. Flask for deploying APIs.
  1. NodeJs for the backend server.
  1. HTML, CSS, JS for the frontend.
